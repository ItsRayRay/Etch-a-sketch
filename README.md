# Etch-a-sketch

This is my second project created as part of The Odin Project curriculum. The project is an "Etch a Sketch" web application built using JavaScript and the Document Object Model (DOM) manipulation.

Users can use their mouse to draw sketches on a grid, and the color of the grid cells changes as they move their mouse across the screen. The application also includes a button to reset the grid and start over.

For a retro look and feel, I used the NES.css framework, which is a collection of nostalgic, 8-bit inspired styles for web development. The framework allowed me to easily create a classic Nintendo-inspired interface for the Etch a Sketch application.

This project was a great way to learn about manipulating the DOM and using a CSS framework.
